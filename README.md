# Review-Classifier

This project is used to classify review using Naive Bayes Algorithm trained on a set of reviwes from a dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe ).
Also, using TextBlob, the comment's Polarity is found. We use the polarity as a metric to verify whether the predicted class is true or false.

### Note: The Whole Dataset is not included becuse it is too large. Can be found in the link above.
